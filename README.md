## Introduction

Sentiment-Stock-Prediction is a Python-based project that leverages sentiment analysis to improve stock price prediction accuracy. By combining historical stock price data with sentiment scores derived from news articles or social media, the project aims to provide more informed investment insights.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to predict stock prices by incorporating sentiment analysis, helping users make data-driven investment decisions. The focus is on exploring the relationship between market sentiments and stock price movements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KannurAnudeepRaj/Sentiment-Stock-Prediction.git
   cd Sentiment-Stock-Prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python SentimentStockPrediction.py
   ```

## Usage

- The `SentimentStockPrediction.py` script includes the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- Adjust the script based on your data sources, model preferences, and additional features.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- textblob
- joblib

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `SentimentStockPrediction.py`: Main script containing the project workflow.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `data/`: Placeholder for storing input data.
- `models/`: Placeholder for storing trained models.

## Model Deployment (Optional)

- The trained model can be saved and loaded for real-time predictions.
- Use the `joblib` library for saving and loading models.
- Example deployment code is available in `SentimentStockPrediction.py`.

## Documentation

### Methodology and Findings:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Historical stock price data was collected from [Data Source].
   - News articles and social media data were obtained using [APIs/Web Scraping].

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Stock price data was cleaned, handling missing values and outliers.
   - Text data was preprocessed by removing stop words and performing sentiment analysis.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - TextBlob was used for sentiment analysis, assigning polarity scores to news articles.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Combined stock price data with sentiment scores.
   - Additional features included [list any other features].

5. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - RandomForestRegressor was chosen for stock price prediction.
   - The model was trained on [Training Set] and fine-tuned.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE) was used to evaluate the model on [Testing Set].
   - The achieved MSE was [MSE value].

7. **Model Deployment:**
   - The trained model was saved as [model_filename].
   - For real-time predictions, load the model and use new data.

8. **Future Improvements:**
   - Explore more advanced models such as [models].
   - Incorporate additional features and external factors for enhanced prediction.

## Future Improvements

- Explore advanced machine learning models like [list potential models].
- Incorporate more features such as [list additional features].
- Optimize hyperparameters for better model performance.
